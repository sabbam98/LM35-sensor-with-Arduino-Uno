# LM35-sensor-with-Arduino-Uno
This project uses an LM35 sensor with Arduino Uno to measure real-time temperature. The sensor output is read through analog pin A0, converted into Celsius, and displayed on the Serial Monitor. It is simple, accurate, and useful for home, lab, or greenhouse temperature monitoring.
